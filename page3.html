      <p>This project titled DERMISONDERMISONDERMIS, is inspired by the Net Art project titled SKINONSKINONSKIN which was a site created by artists Auriea Harvey and Michael Samyn containing a series of digital love letters sent between the two in 1999. Adriana and I decided to create similar sites  which mimicked their project. My idea was to show  love letters, photos, and  gifs that i would send to a love interest in the situation of the orignal artists. Each of our sites is unique to us but follows the same structure. This idea came about when reading Quaranta's essay. A key point that stuck with us was the fact that Net Art was for everyone, it was free, and without restrictions for people to use. So we used it. We used most of the structure of SKINONSKINONSKIN and also made it our own. For comparison, here is a link to the Net Art Anthology project SKINONSKINONSKIN: </p>
