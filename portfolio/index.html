        <p>Sarah is an artist from the South Bay Area. Born and raised in South San Jose, she has grown up with an affinity for all things nature and uses her love for the natural world to inspire her creativity. Growing up with an environment friendly family, Sarah has known the word "recycle" since a young age, and strives to reuse items as an alternate canvas to a store bought canvas. Often, she saves canvases from the trash and adorns her own art on top of the original background, to create something fresh and fun.</p>
