                     Sarah is an artist from the South Bay Area. Born and raised in South San Jose, she has grown up with an affinity for all things nature and uses her love for the natural world to inspire her creativity. Growing up with an environment friendly family, Sarah has known the word 'recycle' since a young age, and strives to reuse items as an alternate canvas to a store bought canvas. Often, she saves canvases from the trash and adorns her own art on top of the original background, to create something fresh and fun. In addition to incorporating nature, the female form is an area of interest that viewers might notice with the artist's work. Besides painting on 2-d objects, Sarah enjoys incorporating mixed media into many creations, and is often inspired by spur of the moment thoughts to bring a piece to fruition.

                     Starting with something other than a blank canvas is preferable for Sarah. Using an image or some already painted background as a starting point pushes the artist to use a creative approach, and a going with the flow attitude to produce her art, and also flows over to her life. While having the starting point of the original image, the artist will turn the canvas around, and incorporate a portion of the art into her finished piece. Leaving some of the art untouched, and juxtaposing the two images together is exciting and fun for Sarah. She feels that art can be art for just the intent of creating something fun, interesting, and weird for she and others to view. There is definitely space in her practice to make art that has a political or social voice, but mostly she enjoys utilizing the basic elements of art and principals of design to create. </p>
